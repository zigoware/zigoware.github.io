Generate the following YAML block and append it to the file /blog-posts/posts.yml

--- <include these dashes>
id: <generate a unique and short two-to-three-word id for the blog post. Ensure each blog post has its own unique id. If the blog post is very similar in topic to another post, it should have the same id, but with a number appended to the end after a hyphen (-). The number should increase as posts become more recent.>
