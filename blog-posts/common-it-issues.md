Technology is the backbone of nearly every modern business, but when it fails, productivity can take a serious hit. As an IT support professional or tech-savvy user, being able to quickly identify and resolve common problems can make a huge difference. Here are five frequent IT issues — and how to fix them.

## 1. **Slow Computer Performance**

### 🔍 The Problem:
Over time, computers can become sluggish due to software bloat, low disk space, or unnecessary background processes.

### 💡 The Solution:
- Uninstall unused applications.
- Disable unnecessary startup programs (`Task Manager > Startup`).
- Perform a disk cleanup (`cleanmgr.exe`).
- Add more RAM if the system is consistently using high memory.

## 2. **Wi-Fi Connectivity Issues**

### 🔍 The Problem:
Users often experience dropped connections or slow internet speeds, especially in larger offices or buildings with interference.

### 💡 The Solution:
- Restart the router/modem.
- Update network drivers.
- Use a Wi-Fi analyzer to check for channel interference.
- Set up mesh networks or signal boosters in larger areas.

## 3. **Forgotten Passwords**

### 🔍 The Problem:
Password resets are one of the most common help desk requests, especially in organizations with strict security policies.

### 💡 The Solution:
- Use password management tools like Bitwarden or LastPass.
- Set up self-service password reset portals (e.g., through Azure AD).
- Encourage multi-factor authentication (MFA) to reduce reliance on passwords alone.

## 4. **Software Not Responding**

### 🔍 The Problem:
Applications freezing or crashing can interrupt important tasks and frustrate users.

### 💡 The Solution:
- Force quit the application and restart it.
- Check for software updates or patches.
- Reinstall the application if corruption is suspected.
- Monitor system logs to identify recurring crash patterns.

## 5. **Printer Issues**

### 🔍 The Problem:
From “printer not found” to “print queue stuck,” printer issues are an age-old IT headache.

### 💡 The Solution:
- Ensure the printer is online and properly connected.
- Clear and restart the print spooler (`services.msc > Print Spooler`).
- Reinstall or update the printer driver.
- Try printing from a different device to isolate the problem.
