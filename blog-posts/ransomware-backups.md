# The Importance of Backups in Ransomware Defense

*This post was generated using AI*

Ransomware attacks are on the rise, with organizations facing costly downtime, data loss, and reputation damage. A robust backup strategy is your best defense.

## Why Backups Matter

Backups provide a recovery path when data is encrypted or destroyed by malicious actors. Without them, your only option may be to pay the ransom — which doesn’t guarantee recovery.

## Best Practices

### 📅 Backup Regularly
Automate daily or even hourly backups of critical systems and files.

### 🔒 Use Immutable Storage
Store backups in a format that prevents alteration or deletion, even by attackers.

### 🌐 Keep Offsite Copies
Air-gapped or cloud-based backups protect against on-premises disasters.

### 🔁 Test Restores
Regularly verify that you can restore from backups — don’t wait until an emergency.

## Final Note

Backup is not just a technical checkbox. It’s a core pillar of business continuity. Invest in it like your business depends on it — because it does.
